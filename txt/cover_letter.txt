I have 2+ years of work experience in ML and NLP. The main Python libraries I use are: Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for basic ML; Spacy, RegEx, Gensim, and NLTK for NLP; and Tensorflow or PyTorch for neural networks. I have been responsible for algorithms in the following fields: author name disambiguation, topic modelling, text generation (e.g. autocompletion), record linkage deduplication, and hierarchical multi-label classification. I worked comfortably with both Hebrew and English datasets. I am familiar with different approaches used in NLP, e.g. Count vectorizers (e.g. BoW, TF-IDF), word embeddings (e.g. Word2Vec, GloVe), and encoders (e.g. BERT). I developed modules and classes for deploying my code into production. Finally, I am comfortable creating my own tools for assessing the performance of my models, e.g. interactive confusion matrix.
I have decided that I want to work with a team whose projects are innovative and will be built on a solid foundation, and I believe that what your team is doing could be a great match.
