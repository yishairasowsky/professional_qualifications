## Professional Projects:
1. [Text Classifer](#Text-Classifer)
2. [Data Extractor](#Data-Extractor)
3. [Keyword Finder](#Keyword-Finder)
4. [Reference Extractor](#Reference-Extractor)

### 1. Text Classifer
- Two-stage hierarchical architecture
- Very precise multi-Label tagging for 4000 topics
- English and Ancient Hebrew Dataset
### 2. Data Extractor 
- Created NLP entity extractor for lease contracts using rule-based logic.
- Developed interactive confusion matrix and statistics to evaluate predictions.
- Achieved accuracy of >90% for some entities; boosted precision/recall by 20%.
### 3. Keyword Finder
- Implemented in Hebrew language
- From an input sentence, this application returns the most important word or phrase
- Leverages part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing
### 4. Reference Extractor
- Locates technical citiations from legal documents
- Enhanced search algorithm to 90% accuracy
