## **Professional Projects:**
<!-- 1. [Text Classifer](#Text-Classifer)
2. [Data Extractor](#Data-Extractor)
3. [Keyword Finder](#Keyword-Finder)
4. [Reference Extractor](#Reference-Extractor) -->

#### **1. Text Classifer**
- Two-stage hierarchical architecture
- Very precise multi-Label tagging for 4000 topics
- English and Ancient Hebrew Dataset
- See the [article](https://yishairasowsky.medium.com/multi-label-text-classification-d44105d581d6) and [code](https://github.com/yishairasowsky/Sefaria-Project/blob/master/ML/scripts/multi_label_classification.py)
#### **2. Data Extractor**
- Created NLP entity extractor for lease contracts using rule-based logic.
- Developed interactive confusion matrix and statistics to evaluate predictions.
- Achieved accuracy of >90% for some entities; boosted precision/recall by 20%.
#### **3. Keyword Finder**
- Implemented in Hebrew language
- From an input sentence, this application returns the most important word or phrase
- Leverages part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing
#### **4. Reference Extractor**
- Locates technical citiations from legal documents
- Enhanced search algorithm to 90% accuracy
- Used Regex and my own enhancements to refine the search precision and recall
