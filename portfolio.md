## **Professional Projects:**
####  **Text Classifer:** 
- Two-stage hierarchical architecture.
- Very precise multi-Label tagging for 4000 topics.
- English and Ancient Hebrew dataset.
- Please [read this article](https://yishairasowsky.medium.com/multi-label-text-classification-d44105d581d6) I wrote about the project.
- You can also [view the code](https://github.com/yishairasowsky/Sefaria-Project/blob/master/ML/scripts/multi_label_classification.py) on GitHub.
- Learn more about the company [here](http://www.sefaria.org).

#### **FinTech Extractor**
- Created NLP entity extractor for lease contracts using rule-based logic.
- Developed interactive confusion matrix and statistics to evaluate predictions.
- Achieved accuracy of >90% for some entities; boosted precision/recall by 20%.
- I cannot show the code, because it belongs to [SMRTflow](https://www.linkedin.com/company/trullion).

#### **Keyword Finder**
- Implemented in Hebrew language.
- From an input sentence, this application returns the most important word or phrase.
- Leverages part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing.
- I cannot show the code, because it belongs to [Slideo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eladdarmon/).

#### **Reference Extractor**
- Locates technical citiations from legal documents
- Enhanced search algorithm to 90% accuracy
- Used Regex and my own enhancements to refine the search precision and recall
- I cannot show the code, because it belongs to [Waymark.tech](https://www.waymark.tech/).
